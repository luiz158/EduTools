###What does this code do? (Part 1)

When programmers develop a program or some code they spend some amount of time creating it. The code then goes into production and may be run for weeks, months, years, or decades. The IRS is still using programs developed in the early 1970's. Those programs have changed since their first inception. Imagine the number of new tax laws that have to be added to the IRS program's code each year. Estimates vary, but over 80% of your code's lifetime will be spent in maintenance. That means you should give your variables meaningful names. It also means you should use comments generously. This will make it easier for the next person to maintain your program.
